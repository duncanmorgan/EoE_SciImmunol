This repository contains the code used to assemble, process, and analyze the data from the paper: "Clonally expanded, GPR15-expressing T cells are associated with eosinophilic esophagitis", published in Science Immunology (Morgan et al.,  2021). This paper utilizes paired single-cell transcriptome and TCR sequencing to conduct an analysis of cells from the esophageal biopsies, duodenal biopsies, and peripheral blood of patients with an allergic disease called eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).

The data analyzed in this paper can be obtained from GEO, accession number GSE175930. If you're interested in analyzing this data yourself, I'd recommend taking a look at the "DataAssembly" folder. This code contained in this folder will help to to process the data into the same Seurat object analyzed in the paper and to integrate the patient/TCR metadata.
